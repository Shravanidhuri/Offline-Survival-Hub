Chaos Survival Hub 🌍💥

Chaos Survival Hub is a fun, interactive, browser-based survival forum designed to simulate an apocalyptic environment. Users can submit survival tips, vote on others’ tips, comment, and see random “Message in a Bottle” tips, all in a neon, glitchy, chaotic interface.

Perfect for hackathons, coding experiments, or just a fun chaotic web experience.
